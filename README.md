The Vision (so far)
---

Would like an app which chronologically logs my current thoughts, and any side thoughts I might have. X / Vim keybindings. Loom timeline view.

Gonna look like this:

```
O-->O-->O-->O-->O
    |       |
    O       O
            |
            O
```

Can also switch the view mode to real-time view, where the branches are less structured and fall into when they were actually posted, like so:

```
O--O--->O->O--->O
   \    \
    O    O--\
          \  \
           O  O
```

Must be fun to use.
